# Dog-Adoption-Site

For this project, our group decided to make a webpage that used two APIs. The two API's we used was a random dog picture generator, and the Petfinder API. We also used a Bulma as a CSS foundation. The random dog picture generator displayed three random images of dogs. When the user clicked the image, the Petfinder API was called. This API allowed us to display dogs that had the same breed as the random dog along with the description. If the image of the PetFinder dog was clicked, it would bring the user to the Petfinder adoption form. If the random dog breed was not up for adoption, a message would appear if there was no dog for adoption.
